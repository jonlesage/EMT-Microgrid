# Electromagnetic Transient (EMT) Microgrid Model for Control Studies

This example is used in the "Microgrid System Development and Analysis" Video Series. This particular example is used in "Part 3: Using Simscape Power Systems to Simulate Microgrids": https://www.mathworks.com/videos/series/microgrid-system-development-and-analysis.html
Simscape Electrical can be used to simulate transient analysis of microgrid with various different distributed energy resources (DERs). The DERs in this example include renewables, such as solar, a diesel GenSet, and an energy storage system (ESS). Transient studies allow for understanding of dynamics of the microgrid controller.
